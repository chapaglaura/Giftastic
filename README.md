## **What is it?**
A GIF search with none other than humanâ€™s best friend (though you can add any other categories). You can choose between a large variety of dog breeds or, if you prefer, add any other one by filling the text box and submitting a new one. As simple as that. Have fun!

## **How to play:**
1. Select a dog breed from the buttons or add your own (this will create a new button).

2. Click the dog breed you want to look for GIFs of.

3. 10 GIFs of this selection will be added to the page but just their main frame.

4. If you would like to see the animated GIF, just click on it (as easy as pie!).

5. A second click on it will pause the GIF.

6. You can continue choosing different dog breeds or adding new ones, the GIFs will keep being added at the end of the page.

**Hope you like it!**
